## Hi Y'all

I'm Rob McCormick and I am getting started with Github, Markdown and Python.


Github links to review:
- [Github Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown) for obvious reasons.
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) themes are well put together.

## Notes on Vim

- [Damian Conway's .vimrc file](https://github.com/thoughtstream/Damian-Conway-s-Vim-Setup)

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

Edit remotely:
Use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/remccormick/remccormick.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

When you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

Details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/remccormick/remccormick.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
